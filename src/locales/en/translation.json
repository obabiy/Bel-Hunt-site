Hunting in Belarus.<br/><br/>So, let's me introduce Belarus as one of the direction of big and small hunting games in Europe. I deal in the big and small hunting game 10 years spending more time with Eastern Europe hunting game fans. 25 years ago my colleague began with the first hunters from Europe in the times of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Since Belarus has been changed much regarding the big and small hunting game. It’s quite difficult to compete with other countries of more o less savage hunting game which attracts attention of abroad hunting game funs, but we’re trying to raise the hunting game level each year.<br/><br/>In the section Prices it’s possible to become familiar with the hunting game species in Belarus. I’m always glad to answer questions about the big and small game hunting in our part of the Europe.",
